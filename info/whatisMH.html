                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Mental health is an aspect of our overall health that is measured by our capacity to function within our daily lives. It is an equal of a component of our overall health as physical health is. The World Health Organization defines
                            mental health as "a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or
                            her community”.<br></p>
                        <p>Although it sounds confusing it essentially connects psychological well-being and an ability to function at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioral adjustment. This pushes the idea that mental health is on a continuum
                            rather than people being mentall ill or mentally well.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <h2>What is the mental health continuum?</h2>
                        <p>We are all on the continuum and can move up and down according to factors such as our genetic makeup and upbringing, our life circumstances and the stresses we are under. At one end of the continuum, there are mental disorders
                            like depression or anxiety, on the other end we have states of positive mental health when we are thriving, content and fulfilled. The aim of intervention methods is to push people up the continuum so they can reach their full
                            potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <figure></figure>
                        <p>Within the low end of the continuum, we have mental disorders.&nbsp; These are categorized by their effect on an individual’s behaviour. Some examples, that will be explored in detail later on, are: anxiety disorders, mood disorders,
                            psychotic disorders, eating disorders, impulse control and addiction disorders, personality disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. When you are comparing mental health to physical health,
                            it also exists on a continuum, the state of being physically healthy is never static and is a process. Similar to mental health, our goal is to feel content and fulfilled with our wellness. Through intervention and treatment
                            methods, professionals are able to tackle mental illnesses and work individuals up the spectrum to become the best that they can be.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>Throughout the continuum, several influences carry the potential to slow an individuals progress to achieving positive mental health. Specifically for youth, this entails daily feats such as building peer relationships, public
                            speaking, achieving high grades, and many more situations that are difficult and can harm mental wellness. However, by tackling problems individually and following our support tips found later in this module, we will be able
                            to get through them and continue the journey to achieving positive mental health. However, one of the largest barriers that stands in the way for many, is the stigma surrounding mental illness. Mental health is just as important
                            as physical health, taking the first step to seek help can be hard but it is important to not fear judgement. By getting over the fear of being judged it opens a world of possibilities to seek treatment and help. This takes
                            us one step closer to reaching the end of the continuum. <br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/mentalhealth2.jpg" style="height:auto;">
                        <p>With all this talk of “positive mental health” it may be difficult to understand before defining what it means to a person. Positive mental health includes: feeling in control of your life and personal decisions, being able to
                            cope with life's challenges and stresses, functioning well mentally, such as being able to focus while at work, being generally optimistic about life events, this means having hope that good things can, do and will happen in
                            your life, feeling physically healthy, getting enough sleep, feeling like you belong to your community. When you have positive mental health, you are able to handle problems and challenges more easily and be resilient. If you
                            are resilient, you have the ability to learn new skills, ideas and concepts, the ability to adapt to change and new situations, healthy self-esteem, this means having a positive attitude about yourself, confidence when managing
                            conflict, personal support from family and friends, good ways of coping with stress, such as knowing how to: relax, practise positive self-talk to think through situations before acting and to prevent negative thoughts, avoid
                            stressful social relationships, such as interacting with people who make you feel bad about yourself or uncomfortable, plan pleasant events for yourself and keeping those plans. <br></p>
                        <p>By working and taking steps toward maintaining positive mental health, it will help you better understand yourself and others as you find ways to be more happy with yourself and increase your self-esteem. By working through the
                            continuum, with the help of professionals, friends, family and peers, it builds the resilience needed to endeavour through stressful periods in everyday life and other tough situations. Find steps in the module to receive more
                            information about different mental illnesses, how they work and how to seek help. <br></p>
